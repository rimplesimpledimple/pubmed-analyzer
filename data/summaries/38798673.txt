The research paper titled "Identification and Pharmacological Targeting of Treatment-Resistant, Stem-like Breast Cancer Cells for Combination Therapy" aims to identify and target cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in breast cancer that exhibit resistance to standard chemotherapy. These cells, characterized by high tumor-initiating potential, pose a significant challenge in achieving durable cancer remissions. The study employs single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze breast cancer samples from seven metastatic patients, identifying master regulator (MR) proteins that govern the transcriptional state of chemoresistant CSLCs.

The researchers utilized the metaVIPER algorithm to infer protein activity from scRNA-seq data, revealing a conserved CSLC MR signature across different breast cancer subtypes. The study identifies albendazole, an anthelmintic drug, as a potential MR-inverter that can deplete CSLCs without significant cytotoxicity. This was validated through in vivo experiments using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, where albendazole demonstrated synergy with paclitaxel, a common chemotherapeutic agent, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy.

The findings suggest that network-based approaches can effectively identify combinatorial therapies targeting chemoresistant cancer subpopulations. The study highlights the potential of repurposing non-oncology drugs like albendazole to improve treatment outcomes in breast cancer by targeting resistant CSLCs, thereby preventing tumor relapse and progression. This research underscores the importance of understanding tumor heterogeneity and leveraging single-cell analyses to develop more effective cancer therapies.
