This study developed a novel fluorescent probe system for identifying macrophage polarization phenotypes. The researchers created a nanoprobe by combining DNA recognition sequences for macrophage polarization protein markers with polyA20 tails on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), followed by hybridization with Cy5 fluorescent reporter sequences. The probe was designed to detect specific mRNA markers (CD80 for M1 and CD206 for M2 macrophages) through base complementary pairing. The research demonstrated that the nanoprobes exhibited high sensitivity, specificity, and stability in detecting polarized macrophage target sequences both in vitro and in cellular imaging. Key findings showed that the probes could effectively distinguish between M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes in both mouse RAW264.7 and human THP-1 cell lines. The nanoprobes demonstrated strong resistance to nuclease degradation and showed no significant cytotoxicity in living cells. The fluorescent signals were only produced in the presence of specific target sequences, with M1-CD80 probes showing strong signals in M1 macrophages and M2-CD206 probes in M2 macrophages. This method provides a straightforward and efficient approach for real-time visualization of macrophage polarization states, offering potential applications in tracking macrophage behavior in disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The technology's ability to identify inflammatory M1 macrophages and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages makes it particularly valuable for studying macrophage-related diseases.
