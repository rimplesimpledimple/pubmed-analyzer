This review paper examines the development, challenges, and future perspectives of targeting the CD47/SIRPα pathway in cancer treatment. The study was motivated by recent setbacks in clinical trials, including the discontinuation of the phase 3 ENHANCE study of Magrolimab plus Azacitidine for myelodysplastic syndromes in 2023. The authors analyze the CD47/SIRPα signaling pathway's role in cancer immunotherapy, reviewing both preclinical and clinical evidence across various malignancies including lymphoma, leukemia, and solid tumors. The research highlights several key findings: 1) CD47 acts as an innate immune checkpoint that, when overexpressed on cancer cells, helps them evade immune system detection; 2) While CD47-targeted therapies showed initial promise, they face significant challenges including toxicity concerns and limited efficacy; 3) Novel approaches such as SIRPα-Fc fusion proteins and bispecific antibodies may offer better therapeutic options with reduced side effects. The paper also identifies specific challenges in drug development, including hematotoxicity and the need for careful dosing strategies. The authors propose several potential solutions for enhancing CD47/SIRPα-targeted drug development, including structure modifications, dual blockade strategies, and novel drug delivery systems. They conclude that despite recent setbacks, CD47/SIRPα pathway targeting remains promising for cancer immunotherapy, particularly when combined with innovative approaches and proper patient selection.
