This review paper examines the challenges and developments in targeting the CD47/SIRPα pathway for cancer immunotherapy. The study was motivated by recent setbacks in clinical trials, particularly the discontinuation of phase 3 ENHANCE study of Magrolimab plus Azacitidine for myelodysplastic syndromes in 2023. The authors analyze the current landscape of CD47-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and SIRPα-Fc fusion proteins. The review identifies several key challenges, notably the widespread expression of CD47 on normal cells leading to toxicity concerns, particularly anemia and off-target myelosuppression. The paper highlights promising developments, such as IMM01, a recombinant SIRPα-Fc fusion protein that shows enhanced efficacy without significant toxicity due to its moderate binding affinity and lack of red blood cell binding. The authors also discuss various strategies to improve CD47-targeted therapies, including novel drug delivery systems, dual blockade approaches, and combination therapies. The review concludes that despite recent setbacks, CD47/SIRPα pathway targeting remains a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy, particularly when using optimized approaches like SIRPα-Fc fusion proteins. The paper emphasizes the need for continued research to refine these therapeutic strategies and overcome current limitations, suggesting that with proper optimization, CD47-targeted therapies could potentially achieve effectiveness comparable to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
