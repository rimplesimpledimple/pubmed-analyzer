This study investigated the expression profiles of CD133, CD47, and PD-L1 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) and their association with metastatic disease. Using immunohistochemistry, researchers analyzed 51 HGSC tissue samples (31 metastatic and 20 non-metastatic) from Indonesian patients.

Key findings revealed that CD133 and CD47 showed strong expression in 52% and 66% of tissue samples, respectively. CD133 expression was significantly higher in metastatic cases (20 out of 31 patients, p=0.039), while CD47 expression was elevated in 26 of 31 metastatic samples (p=0.001). Conversely, PD-L1 showed negative expression in 62.7% of samples and was inversely correlated with metastatic disease (p=0.023). While age showed no significant correlation with any marker expression, Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) demonstrated varied relationships with CD133 and PD-L1 expression (p=0.046 and p<0.001 respectively).

The study found a moderate correlation between CD133 and PD-L1 expression, while CD47 showed minimal correlation with both markers. The researchers concluded that CD133, CD47, and PD-L1 expression may dynamically increase as primary lesions progress to metastatic stages, suggesting their involvement in HGSC progression. Despite study limitations due to sample size, these markers could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for HGSC treatment.
