This study investigated ways to overcome resistance to natural killer (NK) cell therapy in Ewing sarcoma (ES), a pediatric bone cancer with poor survival rates for metastatic cases. The researchers identified that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) negatively regulate NK cell function in the ES tumor microenvironment. To address this resistance, they developed a three-pronged therapeutic approach combining: 1) NK cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), 2) NKTR-255 (an IL-15 receptor agonist to improve NK cell persistence), and 3) magrolimab (a CD47 blockade to reactivate macrophage anti-tumor activity). Through in vitro studies and mouse xenograft models, they demonstrated that MCAM-CAR-NK cells showed enhanced cytotoxicity against ES cells and reduced lung metastasis compared to unmodified NK cells. NKTR-255 improved NK cell survival and sustained NK expansion, while magrolimab enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of ES cells. The combination of all three therapeutic components significantly decreased both primary tumor growth and lung metastasis, leading to prolonged animal survival in both cell-based and patient-derived xenograft models. This was superior to any single agent or two-agent combination. The study provides evidence that this combinatorial innate immunotherapy approach effectively circumvents multiple resistance mechanisms in the ES tumor microenvironment and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic ES.
