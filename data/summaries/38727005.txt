This review paper examines the development of small molecule drugs targeting immune checkpoints for cancer treatment. The study's main objective was to summarize current advances in small molecule immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and analyze their underlying mechanisms. While antibody-based ICIs have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy, they face limitations including poor tissue permeability, side effects, and high costs. Small molecule drugs are presented as a promising alternative due to their better tissue penetration, predictable pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and lower manufacturing costs. The paper focuses on several key immune checkpoint targets, particularly PD-1/PD-L1 and CD47/SIRPÎ± pathways. Notable small molecule drugs discussed include BMS-202, CA-170, YPD-30, and INCB086550, which have shown encouraging results in preclinical or clinical trials. The authors detail how these molecules work by either directly blocking immune checkpoint interactions, inhibiting their expression, or promoting their degradation. The review also highlights emerging approaches in drug development, including the use of artificial intelligence for screening and designing new compounds. The authors conclude that while small molecule ICIs show great potential, challenges remain in screening optimal target sites and drug design due to incomplete structural information about immune checkpoint pairs. The paper suggests that continued advances in structural studies and innovative chemical approaches will be crucial for developing more effective small molecule ICIs.
