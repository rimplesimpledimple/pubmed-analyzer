This study aimed to develop a novel therapeutic strategy using engineered monocytes to prevent atherosclerotic plaque progression. The researchers designed a complex called CD47p-GQDs-miR223 that interacts with SIRPα to remodel monocytes and decrease their uptake of oxidized LDL through CD47-SIRPα signaling activation. The system combines phagocytosis inhibition with anti-inflammatory regulation to target foam cell formation, which is a key driver of atherosclerosis. The researchers used various techniques including cell culture, animal models, immunofluorescence, and molecular analysis to evaluate the system's efficacy. Key findings showed that the engineered monocytes successfully: 1) competed for recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques, 2) exhibited reduced uptake of oxidized LDL through CD47-SIRPα signaling, 3) released gene drugs to mediate anti-inflammatory phenotypic remodeling of aboriginal macrophages, and 4) effectively inhibited foam cell development. In vivo studies using Apoe-/- mice demonstrated that the system significantly decreased plaque formation, reduced inflammatory markers, and improved lipid metabolism profiles. The treatment showed good biocompatibility with no significant toxicity to major organs. This novel approach provides a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing atherosclerosis progression by simultaneously addressing both excessive lipid uptake and inflammation through engineered cell therapy.
