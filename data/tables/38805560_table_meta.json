  "footnotes": "Data represents the effects of MPS1i treatment compared to DMSO control on B16F10 cells and macrophage activity. Micronuclei induction and aneuploidy percentages indicate chromosomal instability. M1-like and M2-like macrophage markers reflect polarization states. Tumor growth and immune cell infiltrate metrics are based on in vivo experiments."
