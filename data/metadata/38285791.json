  "title": "CD133, CD47, and PD-L1 Expression in Ovarian High-grade Serous Carcinoma and Its Association with Metastatic Disease: A Cross-sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a primary cause of cancer-related death in women. At the time of diagnosis, the majority of ovarian malignancies had metastasized. It is believed that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and immune evasion play a crucial role in the metastatic process. The objective of this study was to describe the expression profiles of cluster of differentiation (CD)133, CD47, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) as commonly utilized markers for CSCs and immune evasion. Using an immunohistochemical procedure, 51 HGSC tissue samples were stained with anti-CD133, anti-CD47, and anti-PDL1 antibodies. The samples contained 31 HGSC with metastases and 20 HGSC absent metastases. The expression of CD133, CD47, and PD-L1 was compared between groups. Strong expression of CD133 and CD47 was seen in 52% and 66% of tissue samples, respectively. Twenty of the thirty-one patients with metastases had a significant level of CD133 expression, with a p-value of 0.039. CD47 expression was increased in 26 of 31 samples with metastatic disease. A 62.7 percent of samples were negative for PD-L1 expression, significantly inversely correlated with HGSC metastatic disease (p=0.023). Although there was no significant association between CD133, CD47, or PD-L1 expression and age, Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes demonstrated a significantly varied relationship. Our findings suggested that expression of CD133, CD47, and PD-L1 may have dynamically increased as the primary lesion progressed to the metastatic lesion, implying that these proteins may be involved in the progression of high-grade serous ovarian cancer from the primary to the metastatic stage.",
