  "abstract": "The success of personalized cancer immunotherapy depends on the initial tumour antigenic presentation to dendritic cells and macrophages. Tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) contain abundant tumour antigenic molecules. The presence of anti-phagocytotic signals such as cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) on the surface of the TEVs, however, leads to evasion of the same dendritic cells and macrophages. Here we show that iron oxide hydroxide nanocomposites can successfully mask TEV surfaces and unblock phagocytosis without affecting extracellular vesicles' elicited immune goals. After internalization, the mask disintegrates in the lysosome, releasing the tumour antigenic cargo. This triggers antigen presentation and promotes dendritic cell activation and maturation and macrophage reprogramming in animal models, leading to a drastic reduction of tumour volume and metastasis, and in human malignant pleural effusion clinical samples. This straightforward masking strategy eliminates the ubiquitous anti-phagocytosis block found in clinical samples and can be applied universally across all patient-specific TEVs as tumour antigenic agents for enhanced immunotherapy.",
