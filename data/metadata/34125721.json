  "title": "Predictors of Success in an Orthopaedic Residency.",
  "abstract": "Orthopaedic surgery is one of the most competitive residencies to match into. Meanwhile, the average applicant's United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) test scores, research involvement, and number of clinical honors increase every year. Measures such as USMLE scores, productivity in research, Alpha Omega Alpha (A\u03a9A) honor society status, number of clinical honors, and performance on away rotations have all been cited as factors contributing to program directors choosing applicants for interviews and ranking them for their program. However, questions remain as to whether these measures translate to success on board examinations, high faculty evaluations, and designation as chief resident during orthopaedic residency. USMLE scores have been shown to correlate with Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) and American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) scores, while clinical grades and A\u03a9A status correlate with faculty evaluations. Participating in research as a medical student was predictive of research productivity in residency but did not correlate with standardized testing scores or faculty evaluations. The literature has suggested ways in which measures such as personality and grit may be used in the application process and how these factors may contribute to predictors of success. However, additional research is needed to measure and define personality and grit during the application evaluation process.",
