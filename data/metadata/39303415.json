  "abstract": "Targeted therapies have revolutionized traditional cancer treatments by precisely targeting tumor cells, enhancing efficacy and safety. Despite this advancement, the proportion of cancer patients eligible for such therapies remains low due to the absence of suitable targets. Here, we investigate whether the translocation of the immunogenic cell death (ICD) marker calreticulin (CALR) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface following ICD induction can serve as a target for targeted therapies. To target CALR, a nanobody Nb215 identified from a na\u00efve VHH phage library with high binding affinity to both human and mouse CALR was employed to engineer probiotic EcN 1917. Our results demonstrated that CALR nanobody-modified EcN-215 coupled with the photothermal dye indocyanine green (ICG) was able to exert NIR-II imaging-guide photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, PTT with EcN-215/ICG can reshape the tumor microenvironment by enhancing the infiltration of CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Furthermore, the antitumor activity of CALR-targeted EcN-215/ICG is synergistically enhanced by blocking CD47-SIRP\u03b1 axis. Collectively, our study provides a proof of concept for CALR-targeted therapy. Given that CALR translocation can be induced by various anticancer therapies across numerous tumor cell lines, CALR-targeted therapies hold promise as a novel approach for treating multiple types of cancers.",
