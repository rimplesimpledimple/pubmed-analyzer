  "title": "CD47-SIRP\u03b1 signaling-inspired engineered monocytes for preventing the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.",
  "abstract": "The accumulation of foam cells in the subendothelial space of the vascular wall to form plaques is the real cause of atherosclerotic lesions. Conventional interventions, such as statins and anti-cytokine or anti-inflammatory therapies, suffer problems in terms of their short therapeutic outcomes and potential disruption of the immune system. The development of more efficient therapeutics to restrict the initial progression of plaques appears to be crucial for treating and preventing atherosclerosis. Decreasing foam cell formation by reversing the excessive phagocytosis of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in macrophages is highly desirable. Here, we developed a strategy based on engineered monocytes to dynamically regulate lipid uptake by macrophages inspired by a CD47-SIRP\u03b1 signaling-induced defect in the phagocytosis of lesional macrophages at the advanced stage of AS. Briefly, a complex called CD47p-GQDs-miR223, which is designed to interact with SIRP\u03b1, was synthesized to remodel monocytes by decreasing the uptake of oxidized LDL through the activation of CD47-SIRP\u03b1 signaling. After injection, these monocytes compete for recruitment to atherosclerotic plaques, release gene drugs and mediate anti-inflammatory phenotypic remodeling of the aboriginal macrophages, effectively inhibiting the development of foam cells. Our strategy provides a new therapeutic for preventing the progression of atherosclerosis.",
