  "title": "Platelet-cloaked alginate-poly (\u03b2-amino ester) a novel platform bioinspired polyelectrolyte nanoparticle for targeted delivery of carboplatin in breast cancer: An in vitro/in vivo study.",
  "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor prognosis. Carboplatin (Crb) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, in TNBC but with serious systemic toxicity and poor tumor targeting. Bioinspired drug-loaded platelets (Plt) and Plt-coated nanocarriers evade macrophage phagocytosis by membrane proteins like CD47. The goal of this study was preparation of a novel alginate-poly (\u03b2-amino ester) (P\u03b2AE) nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted delivery of Crb to TNBC cells by developing and comparison of two bioinspired carriers of Plt membrane (PltM) coated Crb-loaded alginate-poly (\u03b2-amino ester) nanoparticles (PltM@Crb-P\u03b2AE-ALG NPs) and Plt loaded Crb (Plt@Crb). The NPs were prepared by ionic gelation and subsequently were coated by platelet membrane using ultra-sonication method. The loading efficiency, release profile, and in vitro cytotoxicity of both formulations were evaluated on HUVEC and 4\u00a0T1 cells. Additionally, the in vivo tumor targeting, therapeutic efficacy, and organ toxicity of the two formulations were assessed in a murine tumor model. Results showed both Plt@Crb and (PltM@Crb-P\u03b2AE-ALG NPs) exhibited high drug loading efficiency, sustained release, enhanced cytotoxicity against 4\u00a0T1 cells, and decreased cytotoxicity in normal cells (HUVEC) in vitro. In vivo studies revealed that although both formulations considerably improved tumor inhibition compared to free Crb, but the PltM@Crb-P\u03b2AE-ALG NPs demonstrated superior cytotoxicity and therapeutic efficacy, thanks to improved Crb's internalization efficiency, enhanced stability, and controlled release properties.",
